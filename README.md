# 8086_Processor_Simulation
Simulation of a number of commands for an 8086 processor

We have developed a Python program that simulates the functionality of a 8088-8086 processor by generating opcode for various commands. These commands, such as MOV, XOR, and ADD, are converted into machine code, which is the language that computers understand and execute to perform tasks. Our program follows the same principle, taking user-input commands and converting them into unique opcodes based on predefined rules.

Our implementation covers different cases for the MOV instruction, including register-memory, memory-register, register-register, register-immediate, memory-immediate, and displacement scenarios. We have ensured that all possible cases are handled accurately to generate the appropriate opcode.

To use our project, you can simply run the code and input instructions, and the corresponding unique opcode will be displayed as the output. If you have any specific inquiries or need assistance with any aspect of the project, please feel free to ask, and I'll be glad to assist you further.
